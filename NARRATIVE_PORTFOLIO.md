## About Me

I'm a software developer based in Athens, Greece, currently working at **Flarmio** where I build technology solutions across multiple domains. My journey in software development began with a fascination for game development—building a C-based game from scratch during my first year at the **University of Athens (Department of Informatics and Telecommunications)**. That early project evolved into a sustained passion for understanding systems at a deep level.

Over time, I've built **custom vehicle physics engines** for Unreal Engine racing games, **compiled game engines from source**, and gained access to **Epic Games' UnrealEngine repositories**. In parallel, I've delivered production web applications as a full-stack developer at **Knorcedger**, shipping over 20 client-facing platforms across hospitality, transportation, e-commerce, and agriculture sectors.

What drives me is the intersection of **low-level systems understanding** and **user-facing product development**. Whether I'm implementing tire friction models in C++ or building booking engines in TypeScript, I approach problems with the same mindset: understand the fundamentals, build it right, and iterate until it works beautifully.

## Technical Philosophy

I believe the best software comes from understanding systems deeply—not just using libraries, but understanding what's happening underneath. That's why I compile game engines from source, implement physics from first principles, and study algorithm research papers before coding. At the same time, I recognize that production systems need pragmatic solutions: tested code, clean architecture, and timely delivery.

Whether building a custom vehicle physics engine or a hotel booking platform, I bring the same approach: understand the problem, design the solution, build it well, and iterate based on real-world feedback.
